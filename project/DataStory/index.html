          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Evolution of Music</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">December 19, 2017 by <a href="#">Max Premi</a> and <a href="#">Maximilan Rünz</a></p>

          <p>The music world is constantly increasing with lot of songs published everyday from all over the world. Moreover, the world is becoming more connected and this helps to spread music popularity. </p>
          <p> We want to understand how music popularity evolved in the last roughly 60 years, as music is a really important social factor. People express themselves, and lot of cultural events and customs are derived from it. This popularity could help
            explain some movements influence, the creation of some music styles and what makes a song popular. We will use the dataset from MillionSongDB, coupled with some website such as The Echo Nest API (now Spotify) and musicbrainz.
          </p>

          <p>Music is a form of art, and a cultural activity that have been practiced since prehistoric time. Nowadays it is everywhere, and seems inseparable from our life-style, as even humming or hitting an object with your finger makes "music". The evolution
            of this field is thus a really intersting subject to study. It is linked to cultural movement in history, such as the 80's with hippies movement for example but also architecture (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music">Baroque</a>)
            or religion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach">Jean-Sébastien Bach</a>) was indeed doing muisc link to religion). This can help us understand how music evolves with the time with how events and movement influence
            it, but also how music affects these different things. It has also become a big industry, with the apparition of the term "commercial music", and interest more and more people, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lExW80sXsHs">for example this video</a>,
            that collected more than 100 millions views. In this study we will concentrate on music from the 20th century and beginning of 21th century, and we will try to awnser the following questions:

            <ul>
              <li>
                How did music features change during the last 80 years, in terms of duration, style, or even rythm ?
              </li>
              <li>
                What makes a Song popular a few years ago, what make one popular today, and is the formula for a popular song possible to elaborate ?
              </li>
            </ul>
            We will try to awnser these with as much precision as possible in the following lines, while keeping in mind that evolution is a neutral term, and also that popularity is quite subjective.</p>

          <h2>Evolution of Music in General</h2>

          <p>We will concentrate in this section, in the evolution of music in general, meaning we did not do difference between genre of music yet. First we can introduce the first numbers. We had a total of 462546 songs at the beggining, and after cleaning
            (drop where they are to much undefined features or no year), we have aroud 220000 songs. The major features used are the following : the Tempo, Duration, Loudness, Hotness, Terms, TermsFrequency and Termsweight. For the evolution of music
            we had really good result matching historical events, such as the loudness increase, which is a known problem since the 90s. Also change in Tempo with also increase and decrease, and finally duration with high increase from 1950. These results
            are detailled in the following section with more analysis and explanations. The Terms with frequency were used to map song to Parent Genre. We did the mapping ourselves and we achieve an accuracy of 75% which is quite correct. We also did
            a clustering (k-NN) of song to see if we could match the time period of a song, and we did get a result of 55% which is not that good. It is in the original work of the notebook, if you're interested in it.</p>

          <h3>Evolution of Tempo</h3>

          <p>Let's look at the Tempo evolution. </p>

          <div id="div-tempo"> </div>
          <input id="SliderTempo" type="text" />
          <div id="div-tempo-descr"></div>

          <br/>

          <h3>Evolution of Loudness</h3>

          <p>Here we do not need to explain it, we clearly see that the <b>Loudness</b> increased, but why is that and how did the time influence this ? First <b>Loudness</b> is defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness">follow</a> : "That
            attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud.", or more theoritically, it is the subjective perception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure">sound pressure</a>            (which is is the local pressure deviation from the ambient (average, or equilibrium) atmospheric pressure, caused by a sound wave.)

            <div id="div-loudness"> </div>
            <input id="SliderLoudness" type="text" />
            <div id="div-loudness-descr"></div>

            <br/>

            <h3>Evolution of Duration</h3>

            <p>The analysis of songDuration will be done in 3 steps: From the 60s to the 80s, then the 80s to the 2000s and finally from the 2000s to nowadays. First we will discus the gap between 1960 (3 minutes average) to 1980 (3 minutes 45 average).
              <div id="div-duration"> </div>
              <input id="SliderDuration" type="text" />
              <div id="div-duration-descr"></div>

              <br/>


              <h2>Evolution of Genre Population</h2>

              <p>We will talk here about the genre Distribution evolution. We can clearly see the trending genre moving with the time. So this is the evolution of music analyzed in function of the number of songs labelled by genre, we will now look at the
                features changes by genre.</p>
              <div id="div-genres"> </div>

              <div id="div-genres-descr"></div>
              <div id="div-genres-time"> </div>
              <input id="SliderGenres" type="text" />


              <br/>

              <h2>Evolution of specific Genres</h2>
              <h3>Evolution of Loudness</h3>
              <p>The evolution of Loudness by genre confort our observation of Loudness War shown in the previous plots. Indeed there is a clear augmentation of loudness, with a clear higher change for metal, that might be due to the use of distorsion and
                other procedure that increase the song force. We can however see 3 genres that are less affected which are
                <b>Folk,Blues and Jazz</b>. This should be due to the accoustic nature of these genre as it does not use as much electronical material as the other genres.</p>
              <h4>Mean</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-loudness-Mean"> </div>
              <p>Don't know what to say</p>
              <h4>Variation (Maximum - Minimum)</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-loudness-MinMax"> </div>
              <h3>Evolution of Tempo</h3>
              <p>So if we study the evolution of Tempo by genre, most of them actually the same trend as the global one we described earlier, with some exceptions. Indeed <b>Jazz, Folk and Blues</b> music have the same shape of curve but shifted to lower
                BPM after the first raise. This is due to the slow characteristic of these genre which are typically accoustic. It's indeed amazing how they almost perfectly match The <b>Reggae</b> has a trend to go a little higher in term of tempo, this
                is maybe due to the apparition of the Ska subgenre. The curve goes up to 128 instead of 125 and stay a little higher than the other genre. As we have seen previously, <b>Metal</b> is a real special genre with the tendancy to never match
                the other genres. So it's curve is like the <b>Reggae</b> one, but shifted even higher with a BPm that went to 132 and finish at almost 130

              </p>
              <h4>Mean</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-tempo-Mean"> </div>
              <p>So here, for all genre we clearly see and increasing trend, with waves. </p>
              <h4>Variation (Maximum - Minimum)</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-tempo-MinMax"> </div>
