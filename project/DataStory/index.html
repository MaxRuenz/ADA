          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Evolution of Music</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">December 19, 2017 by <a href="#">Max Premi</a> and <a href="#">Maximilan Rünz</a></p>

          <p>The universe of music is constantly growing. Thousands new songs are published each day all over the world. Moreover, the world is becoming more connected and this helps to spread music popularity. </p>
            <p> We wanted to understand how music evolved in the last roughly 60 years, as music is an important social factor. People express themselves, and lot of cultural events and customs are derived from it. This popularity could help
              to explain some movements influences and the creation of some music styles. We have used the dataset from <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">MillionSongDB</a>, coupled with data from websites such as <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a> (now <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>) and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">Musicbrainz</a>.

            <h2> Introduction </h2>

            <p>Music is a form of art, and a cultural activity which has been practiced since prehistoric time. Nowadays it is everywhere. Music seems inseparable from our life-style, as even humming or hitting an object with your finger makes "music". The evolution
              of this field is thus an interesting subject to study. It is linked to cultural movement in history, such as the 80's with hippie movement for example but also architecture (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music">Baroque</a>)
              or religion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach">Jean-Sébastien Bach</a>). This can help us to understand how music evolves with the time, how events and movement influence
              it, but also how music affects epochs. It has also become a big industry, with the apparition of the term "commercial music", and interest of more and more people. E.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lExW80sXsHs">this video</a>
              creates content based on music, and it has more than 100 million views. In this study we will concentrate on music from the 20th century and beginning of 21th century, and we asked ourselves the following questions:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  How did music change during the last 60 years? Which genres were popular when?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How did features like, duration, style or rhythm change?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How did genres change over time?
                </li>
              </ul>
              We will try to answer these questions in this blog post, while keeping in mind that evolution is a neutral term, and that popularity is quite subjective.</p>


          <h2>Dataset</h2>

          <p>
            Before going into details, we will give a introduction to the background of this blog post.
            The analysed dataset consited of ~460.000 Songs. After we cleaned data, the remaining 220.000 songs were analysed.
            The major features used are the following : The tempo, duration, loudness, hotness of Songs and genres and genre weight of artists.
            Unfortunately interesting features like energy and danceability were not usable from the dataset ( 0 for each song ).
            For other features like key and rhythm of songs it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Presented increases and decreases in this blog post might deviate from the values presented in the charts.
            The charts present the average features per year, while the change rates have been calculated using confident intervals in order to ensure correctness.
          </p>

          <h2>Evolution of Music in General</h2>

          <p>
            In this section, we will concentrate on the evolution of music in general, meaning we did not do difference between genre of music yet.
            The three most influcenced features by time are tempo, loudness and duration.
          </p>

          <h3>Evolution of Tempo</h3>

          <p>
            For the tempo one can notice a seven BPM increase from 1960 to 1980. After 1980 the tempo drops by seven BPMs around 1992. In recent years one can notice a BPM inrease of two BPM

          <br/>

          <h3>Evolution of Loudness</h3>

          <p>
            <b>Loudness</b> is defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness">follow</a> : "That
            attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud.", or more theoritically, it is the subjective perception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure">sound pressure</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            One can definetly notice a steep increase of loudness of 5 dB.
            The steepest point of the curve is in the 90s, during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"><b>Loudness War</b></a>
          </p>

            <div id="div-loudness-descr"></div>

            <br/>

            <h3>Evolution of Duration</h3>

            <p>
              For the song duration one can notice a very steep increase in the 60s and 70s.
              During those years the song Duration increased by almost one minute.
              After the 70s the duration still kept increasing until the 2000s, when the duration started to decrease.

              <br/>


              <h2>Evolution of Genre Population</h2>

              <p>Starting from this section we will consider the evolution of music based on different genres.
                 We can clearly see the trending genres moving with the time.</p>

              <input id="SliderGenres" type="text" />


              <br/>

              <h2>Evolution of specific Genres</h2>

              <p>
                In this section we will apply the gained knowledge of genres to the already evaluated features.
              </p>

              <h3>Evolution of Loudness</h3>
              <p>The evolution of Loudness by genre clarifies our observation of Loudness War shown in the previous plots. Indeed there is a clear augmentation of loudness, with a clear higher change for metal, that might be due to the use of distorsion and
                other procedure that increase the song force. We can however see 3 genres that are less affected which are
                <b>Folk,Blues and Jazz</b>. This should be due to the accoustic nature of these genre as it does not use as much electronical material as the other genres.</p>
              <h4>Mean</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-loudness-Mean"> </div>
              <p>Don't know what to say</p>
              <h4>Variation (Maximum - Minimum)</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-loudness-MinMax"> </div>
              <h3>Evolution of Tempo</h3>
              <p>So if we study the evolution of Tempo by genre, most of them actually the same trend as the global one we described earlier, with some exceptions. Indeed <b>Jazz, Folk and Blues</b> music have the same shape of curve but shifted to lower
                BPM after the first raise. This is due to the slow characteristic of these genre which are typically accoustic. It's indeed amazing how they almost perfectly match The <b>Reggae</b> has a trend to go a little higher in term of tempo, this
                is maybe due to the apparition of the Ska subgenre. The curve goes up to 128 instead of 125 and stay a little higher than the other genre. As we have seen previously, <b>Metal</b> is a real special genre with the tendancy to never match
                the other genres. So it's curve is like the <b>Reggae</b> one, but shifted even higher with a BPm that went to 132 and finish at almost 130

              </p>
              <h4>Mean</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-tempo-Mean"> </div>
              <p>So here, for all genre we clearly see and increasing trend, with waves. </p>
              <h4>Variation (Maximum - Minimum)</h4>
              <div id="div-genres-tempo-MinMax"> </div>
